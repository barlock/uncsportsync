# Introduction #

The settings page allows you to change settings of SportSync, including input device, output device, and delay time.


# Details #

In the picture below, the navigation buttons for the Settings page are highlighted.  Each button performs a different action.  "Apply" will apply all the changes you made in the Settings page, but it will not exit the Settings page.  "Save" will apply all the changed settings and exit the Settings page.  "Cancel" will ignore any changes you have made in the Settings window and exit the window.

**Input Device** will allow you to select which input device you want SportSync to pull audio from.  The bar below the **Input Device** selector displays the strength of the audio input.  If there is green fill inside the bar, then the program is receiving input.  _This is a way to test if the program is receiving any sound._

**Output Device** will allow you to select which output device you want SportSync to send the audio to.  Chances are that you will not need to alter this on a standard laptop or computer.  The "Test" button plays a sound clip ("Hark the Sound"!) so you can test that your output device is working correctly.

This selector allows you to change the **Max Delay** in seconds for the SportSync interface.  If you adjust the **Max Delay** and apply it, the _sound cache will reset_.
