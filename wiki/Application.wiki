The delay slider is the main tool you can use for synchronization. With the slider all the way to the left, as is pictured, you will hear live radio with no delay. Each movement of the slider will delay the play back by one tenth of a second and your total delay is displayed above the slider. (see picture below)

== Volume ==

The volume slider controls how loud the radio plays through your speakers. Moving the slider to the right increases the volume and to the left decreases it. The button beside the slider toggles mute on and off so you can quickly mute the playback. 

== Settings ==

This button opens the [Settings] page so you can configure the application to use the right inputs and outputs as well as how long you want the max delay to be.
